The findings that as many as 35% of patients with asthma who present to the emergency department with acute asthma smoke tobacco and that 60% of adult asthma exacerbations are associated with viral infections serve to illustrate the importance of understanding the relationship between tobacco smoke and respiratory viral infections in patients with asthma exacerbations [4, 42] .\n
No asymptomatic cases of Nipah virus infection were documented in contacts of Nipah virus patients who consented to provide a blood specimen (n = 20).
Despite the potential public health impact of viral infections in this population, there is virtually no information on the causes, risk factors, and outcomes of respiratory infection in the HAART era.\n
A survey of respiratory virus infections in adult LTRs found that HCoV accounted for 15% of the viruses detected in either BAL or nasopharyngeal swab, 23 whereas in 82 HSCT patients, four of 85 BAL samples (5%) were found to have HCoV. 248\n
It may be that detection of viral RNA in serum is typical in respiratory virus infections among HCT recipients and that use of sensitive RT-PCR assays enabled us to detect this occurrence.
